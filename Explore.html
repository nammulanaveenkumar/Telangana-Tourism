                        In 1799, the Nizam rulers aided the East India Company in their war with Tipu Sultan. When the
                        Nizam was compelled to sign a subsidiary alliance with the British in the year 1799, he lost his
                        authority over the state’s defence and its external affairs. The Nizam also had to give up the
                        Coastal Andhra and the Rayalaseema regions of his vast kingdom to the British, as he was unable
                        to pay monetarily for the assistance the British rendered during the Nizam’s wars against Tipu
                        Sultan. Coastal Andhra and Rayalaseema then became part of the British Presidency of Madras,
                        while Telangana became part of the princely state of Hyderabad. For a long time, the Nizam lead
                        a privileged and a charmed life. He was considered to be the world’s richest man of his time.

                        The Indian Government refused to entertain a request that Hyderabad would seek a separate status
                        and Operation Polo was initiated to annex Hyderabad state. The Kannada and Marathi speaking
                        areas of Hyderabad state was then merged with Karnataka and Maharashtra respectively while
                        Telugu speaking region of Telangana was merged with Andhra state with Hyderabad as the capital
                        of united Andhra Pradesh state in 1956. Although there was resentment against the merger, there
                        was a period of calm.

                        After the promises made to respect the rights of Telangana were not fulfilled, a separate Telangana agitation was launched in 1969. Following subsequent Gentleman’s agreement and again a period of broken promises and injustice, Telangana movement was given a final push by Shri. K Chandrasekhar Rao in 2001 with the formation of TRS. Finally due to the whole hearted efforts of Telangana society and political parties, the Government of India agreed for creation of a separate Telangana state in July, 2013 and Telangana came into effect on June 2, 2014 as ‘Telangana state’, the 29th state of Indian Union
